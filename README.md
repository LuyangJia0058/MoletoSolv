# MoletoSolv
Machine Learning with Physically Inspired Descriptors to Predict Solvation Free Energies of Neutral and Ionic Solutes in Aqueous and Non-aqueous Solvents

## üìò Project Overview

This project uses machine learning models to predict the **solvation free energies** of **neutral molecules, anions, and cations** in both **aqueous and non-aqueous solvents**.
Each model is constructed based on a series of *physically inspired molecular and solvent descriptors*, covering various factors such as molecular structure, charge distribution, solvent polarity, hydrogen-bond donating/accepting ability, aromaticity, and electronegative halogenic contributions.

Dedicated models were developed for predicting solvation free energies of neutral molecules, anions, and cations.

This study extends our previously published model for predicting hydration free energies of neutral solutes (*J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2023, 14, 1877‚Äì1884*), significantly enhancing its applicability to **ionic systems** and **non-aqueous environments**.

## üìÇ Data Files

The `/data/` folder contains the following files:

- `prediction_results.csv`: Output file containing predicted solvation free energies for solutes in various solvents. 
- `solutes_xyz.zip`: A ZIP archive containing `.xyz` files of solute molecules. All geometries were computed at the **B3LYP/def2-TZVPD** level of theory.
- `solvent_parameters.csv`: Physically inspired descriptors for each solvent.

These files are required for training, prediction, and validation tasks.

## üìÅ Model Files and Usage

The project contains three model directories: `neutral/`, `anion/`, and `cation/`, each corresponding to a solvation free energy predictor for the respective solute type.

- Each folder includes a `dataset.csv` file, which contains the features used for model input.
- To perform prediction, simply run the main script:

```bash
python MoletoSolv.py
